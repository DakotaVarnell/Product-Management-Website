Purpose: 
  This web application was designed to read in data of products within a company, in this case that company is 
  6th Street Music Co.  The data backend is just read in through a text file by java and then each product becomes
  instantiated into an instance of our single-entity class and then finally that single entity class product is added 
  to our ProductCollection class which is the entire inventory of the store at this particular time.  The ProductCollection class
  use many different built in features to manage what happens to the inventory and how it is managed.  The web application provides
  the user two different sign in options, Employee and Customer.  Each option contains their own specific operations that can be 
  done to the inventory of the store.  
  
  -The Employee button will direct the user to different pages that give the user options to edit
   the inventory such as removing, adding, and finding inventory.  
   
  -The Customer button will direct the user to a list of all the available products as well as 
  their corresponding information, the user can add items to their cart and view their cart in
  this section as well.  They may also find pictures of what the particular products look like 
  through this section. 
  
  The web application also provides the store with user authentication so there are only certain individuals that can sign in to 
  do anything on the website.  In this example we just used sample inputs but it could easily be extended to allow for users to be
  created and authenticated based upon the list of created users.  This could also be modified to include the differentiation between 
  customer and employee priviledges depending on the signed in user.
